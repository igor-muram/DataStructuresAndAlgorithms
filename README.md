<li>Solving the problem of graph theory:<br>
"Find the length of the longest simple path from city A to city B in a given system of one-way roads."</li>
<li>An example of the input file and the results of the program for this road system are added to the project.</li>
<li>The departure city is on the first line of the input file.</li>
<li>Destination city is on the second line.</li>
<li>All possible routes between cities are indicated after.</li>
